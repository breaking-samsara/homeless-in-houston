  Homeless in Houston.
</h1>

This application allows homeless people in Houston find homeless shelters that are close by. The application also allows it's users to filter shelters based on certain criteria like 'if pets are allowed'. The application does this by leveraging on google's geolocation API and the web brower's navigation API to find the closest shelter within walking distance of the user.
