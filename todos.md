Todos

- finish filters
  - add sample filter data (Rothko Chapel, Menil Collection)
  - add filter functions for each way to filter in PlaceList (for now)
    - Veteran
    - Services
- see if netlify can deploy develop branch separately
- refactor PlaceList, App
  - App shouldn't have anything presentational
  - PlaceList shouldn't have an 'else'
  - PlaceList shouldn't have any allowFilters
- it does seem like maybe arrays and not objects would be easiest and most readable for filters in placeList
